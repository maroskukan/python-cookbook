# Python Object Oriented Programming

Course notes from Python Object Oriented Programming by Joe Marini.


## Overview

### OOP Principles

- Python does not require you to use objects or classes
- Complex programs are hard to keep organized
- Object-oriented programming organizes and structures code
  - Groups together data and behavior into one place
  - Promotes modularization of programs
  - Isolates different parts of the program from each other

### OOP Terms

- **Class** - a blueprint for creating objects of a particular type
- **Methods** - regular functiosn that are part of a class
- **Attributes** - variables that hold data that are part of a class
- **Object** - a specific instnace of a class
- **Inheritance** - means by which a class can inherit capabilities from another
- **Composition** - means of building complex objects out of other objects
