# Practical Python Course Notes

Course notes from Practical [Python for Beginners](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-python-beginners/table-of-contents) from [Sarah Holderness](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/sarah-holderness).

## Environment

I recommend creating a new python virtual environment for this project using pyenv.

```bash
echo 'practical-python' > .python-version
pyenv virtualenv 3.10.2 practical-python
```
